# Scratch_SenseHat_Animation
Do a little 8x8 animation on the SenseHat with the Raspberry Pi using Scratch
Followed the excellent guide from @catlamin https://catlamin.com/2017/02/12/sense-hat-cat-using-scratch/
on how to do an animation on the SenseHat usng Scratch.
I knew somethings but never knew the ledshowsprite command 
Also, the fantastic tip to use dark colours outewrwise the pixels are too brighty and completely washed out on the SenseHat.
